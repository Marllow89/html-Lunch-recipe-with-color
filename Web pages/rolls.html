        <li> <b> Preparing the oven and baking dish </b> </li>
        <p> 
            Gather ingredients. Preheat the oven to 200 degrees C. Brush
            your baking dish with 1 tablespoon of melted butter.
        </p>
        <li> <b> Making the dough </b> </li>
        <p> 
            Whisk flour, white sugar, baking powder and salt together in a 
            large bowl. Work 3 tablespoons softened butter into flour mixture 
            using your hands until butter is lentil-sized. Pour milk into 
            flour-butter mixture and stir with a rubber spatula until a soft 
            dough forms. 
        </p>
        <li> <b> Preparing the dough </b> </li>
        <p> 
            Turn dough onto a well-floured work surface and roll dough into 
            a square. Brush surface of dough with remaining 2 tablespoons 
            melted butter.
        </p>
        <li> <b> Making the filling </b> </li>
        <p> 
            Whisk 1/4 cup white sugar, brown sugar and cinnamon together 
            in a small bowl. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon cinnamon-sugar mixture 
            in the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle remaining 
            cinnamon sugar over butter-brushed dough.
        </p>
        <li> <b> Making the rolls </b> </li>
        <p> 
            Roll the dough around filling to form a log. Cut the log into 
            several pieces around 4-5 cm wide. Place rolls, cut side up into
            prepared baking dish.
        </p>
        <li> <b> Baking the rolls </b> </li>
        <p> 
            Bake the rolls in the preheated oven until rolls are puffed and 
            lightly golden, 20 to 25 minutes.
        </p>
        <li> <b> Making the frosting </b> </li>
        <p> 
            Beat confectioners' sugar, cream cheese, 1/4 cup softened butter 
            and vanilla extract together in a bowl until frosting is smooth.
            Top hot cinnamon rolls with frosting and serve it.
