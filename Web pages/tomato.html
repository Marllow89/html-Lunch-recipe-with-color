    This tomato soup recipe is simple, quick and perfect to make 
    when tomatoes are ripe in gardens and farmers' markets for a 
    delicious summertime treat. It is delicious with garlic bread
    or a grilled cheese sandwich, but in this case we will be 
    serving it as an entree.

        <li> <b> Combining and boiling </b> </li>
        <p> 
            Combine tomatoes, chicken broth, garlic cloves and a large 
            slice of onion in a stockpot over medium heat. Bring to a 
            boil and gently simmer for about 20 minutes to blend flavors.
        </p>
        <li> <b> Food mill </b> </li>
        <p> 
            Remove from heat and run the mixture through a food mill into
            a large bowl or pan. Discard any stuff left over in the food
            mill.
        </p>
        <li> <b> Butter and flour </b> </li>
        <p> 
            Melt butter over medium heat in the now empty stockpot. Stir 
            in flour to make a roux by cooking, whisking constantly, until
            mixture turns medium brown.
        </p>
        <li> <b> Combining mixtures </b> </li>
        <p> 
            Gradually whisk in a bit of the tomato mixture to prevent lumps
            from forming, then stir in the rest.
        </p>
        <li> <b> Salt and sugar </b> </li>
        <p> 
            Season with salt and sugar to taste.
        </p>
        <li> <b> Serving </b> </li>
        <p> 
            Serve hot and enjoy.
